\begin{abstract}
This thesis is about understanding the performance and behaviour of various existing distributed constraint optimization algorithm approaches (complete, local-iterative message-passing, local-iterative best-response) in context of a dynamic environment, e.g changing constraints or other parameters. The use case for this analysis will be the scheduling problem, which needs to be mapped to the algorithms accordingly. The goals are adding a general module to the existing framework for dcops, which can simulate dynamic environments / parameter changes in various ways, mapping existing dcop algorithms to signal collect and evaluate their performance. An additional goal would be to suggest or test a blended algorithm with local-iterative characteristics that handles change better by applying techniques from dynamic approaches which are not local-iterative. The benchmarking is done with respect to change (resilience to change / stability, amount of variable value changes necessary to bounce back), solution quality (how fast can the algorithms reach a defined quality), Time-to-Convergence (how long does it take to converge).
