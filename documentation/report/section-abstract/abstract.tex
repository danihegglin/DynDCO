Distributed Constraint Optimization is a well-researched subject and the various algorithm allow to solve many problems in various fields like for example graph coloring, traffic flow management or power grid management. However, the often dynamic nature of said problems is often not taken into consideration in the design of those protocols and benchmarking this kind of problems is not well-developed.

This thesis aimed to explore the dynamic properties  and performance of different types of DCOP algorithms with a focus on local-iterative algorithms and especially on the MaxSum algorithm.  A complete, a local-iterative message-passing and a local-iterative best response algorithm for distributed constraint optimization were implemented.  The real-world use case of the meeting scheduling problem was mapped as a Distributed Constraint Optimization Problem for benchmarking. A framework has been designed that allows benchmarking of dynamic changes to constraints, variables and the problem domain. The algorithms have been benchmarked in a static as well as in a dynamic environment with various parameters. The main goal was to evaluate the time vs. solution quality and to try out proposed benchmarking techniques.

RESULTS

The thesis further proposes a solution to store the results of DCOP problem solving and monitoring the live performance of the algorithms.
