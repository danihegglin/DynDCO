First and foremost, I'd like to thank my advisor Mihaela Verman, Research Assistant and PhD Candidate at the DDIS group for her excellent support during the course of this thesis. She was always reachable and helped me with many technical and formal questions. Without her continous efforts and valuable inputs, this work would not have been possible. 
\newline
Special thanks go to Dr. Thomas Scharrenbach for arranging the thesis proposal and his guidance at the beginning of this work. I'd also like to thank Philip Stutz for his work on the Signal/Collect framework that made my research possible and his support in technical questions regarding the usage of the framework.\newline
Finally, I'd like to thank the Dynamic and Distributed Systems Group (DDIS) at the University of Zurich and Prof. Abraham Bernstein for the opportunity to write my master thesis in their department.
