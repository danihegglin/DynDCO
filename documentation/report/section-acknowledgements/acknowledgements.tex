First and foremost, I'd like to thank my advisor Mihaela Verman, Research Assistant and PhD Candidate at the DDIS group. She was always supporting me and helped me with technical and formal questions. She provided me with helpful tipps concerning code quality and continous integration, she always had helpful comments on algorithm performance and papers. She never hesitated to give a comment and help me. She always had time. Without her continous efforts and inputs, this work would not have been possible. \newline
Special thanks go to Dr. Thomas Scharrenbach for arranging the thesis proposal and his guidance at the beginning of this work. I'd also like to thank Philip Stutz for his work on the Signal/Collect framework that made my research possible and his support in technical questions regarding the usage of the framework. I hope his work will be useful to many other people and solve many other problems. \newline
Finally, I'd like to thank the Dynamic and Distributed Systems Group (DDIS) at the University of Zurich and Prof. Abraham Bernstein for the opportunity to write my master thesis in their department. Without it's excellent infrastructure it would not have been possible to run the benchmarks in the given time.
