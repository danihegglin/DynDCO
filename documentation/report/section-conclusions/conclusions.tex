\label{c:conclusions} 

A complete (DPOP), a local-iterative message-passing (MaxSum) and a local-iterative approximate best-response (MGM) algorithm have been implemented. The implementation on top of Signal/Collect was a good fit from a structural point of view.

The meeting scheduling problem has been mapped as a distributed constraint optimization problem, which also was a good fit.

The framework has proven to be a good starting point to dynamically change problems during runtime.

The monitoring platform has proven to be very helpful in the process of implementation as well as in the evaluation.

The results of test have shown that...
