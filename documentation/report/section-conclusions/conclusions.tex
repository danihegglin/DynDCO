%---------------------------------------- what has been done

The meeting scheduling problem has been mapped as a distributed constraint optimization problem, which also was a good fit. the DCOP properties could have been shown to fit very well to the structure of hard and soft constraints.

A complete (DPOP), a local-iterative message-passing (MaxSum) and a local-iterative approximate best-response (MGM) algorithm have been implemented. The implementation on top of Signal/Collect was a good fit from a structural point of view. 
MGM, DPOP have proven to work, MaxSum new structure tried out, has proven to work, promising properties

The framework has proven to be a good starting point to dynamically change problems during runtime. The monitoring platform has proven to be very helpful in the process of implementation as well as in the evaluation.

The results of test have shown that...

Benchmarks for dynamic problem that made sense where...
