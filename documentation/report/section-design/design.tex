- Distributed, Not Dynamic, Complete -> Show what is wrong with this approach regarding dynamic

\section{SBDO for Signal/Collect}

- Distributed, Dynamic, Not-Local-Iterative -> Show what is wrong with this approach regarding dynamic

- Distributed, Not Dynamic, Not-Local-Iterative -> Show what is wrong with this approach regarding dynamic

\section{Algorithm Design with Max/Sum Approach}
\subsection{Why Max/Sum for Dynamic Problems}
-> Local Iterative
-> Good fit for dynamic
-> Better than the above

\section{Algorithm Design with Population-Based Approach}
\subsection{Why Population-Based for Dynamic Problems}
-> Local Iterative, Best-Response?
-> Good fit for dynamic
-> Better than the above
