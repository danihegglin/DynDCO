\chapter{Design}

short description

\section{Meeting Scheduling Problem}

\subsection{Formal Definition}

- General problem and definitions
- hard constraints Different, Same (sources for that)
- timeslot utility design: first slot preference, preferences, soft constraints (free slots, 'blocked' slots)

\subsection{Problem Generation}

\section{Framework}
\subsection{Software Stack}
Signal/Collect

- Explanation of the system
- Explanation of Run Modes and why it is nice
- Explanation of runtime add/remove and why it is nice
- Explanation of the basics behind it (Akka -> relation to play framework)
- !!!! Stretch goal: Implemenation for Slurm done, multi machine is not done yet

\subsection{Parameters}

"execution"
"mode"
"param"
"timeslots"

\subsection{Structure}

class diagram, explanation why I built the structure like this

\subsection{Dynamics Controller}

how does it work, what can it do

\section{Mapping of DPOP}
    
    - Why DPOP
    - Pseudocode

\subsection{Graph Structure}
\subsection{Vertices}

\section{Mapping of MGM}

     - Why MGM
    - Pseudocode

\subsection{Graph Structure}

\section{Mapping of MaxSum}
    
    - Why MaxSum
    - Pseudocode

\subsection{Graph Structure}
\subsection{Vertices}

\section{Monitoring Platform}

    - Why is it needed: lightweight, non-blocking, analysis on other spot, direct transmit to analyzing platform, live monitoring
    - How can http requests be better than filewrites
    - Play framework explanation
- Akka actors as pools for utilities, conflicts, mean, etc.
- Live monitoring with Websockets based on simple example
- supports multiple simultanous test runs
