\section{DCOP Algorithms}
\subsection{Complete - DCOP}

- Distributed, Not Dynamic, Complete -> Show what is wrong with this approach regarding dynamic

\subsection{Dynamic, Complete - RSDPOP}

\subsection{Not local-iterative - SBDO}

- Distributed, Dynamic, Not-Local-Iterative -> Show what is wrong with this approach regarding dynamic

\subsection{Best-Respone - Maximum Gain Messaging}

- Distributed, Not Dynamic, Not-Local-Iterative -> Show what is wrong with this approach regarding dynamic

\subsection{Best Response - DSA}

\subsection{Local Iterative - MaxSum}

-> Local Iterative
-> Good fit for dynamic
-> Better than the above
-> Fewer information disclosure

\subsection{Best Response, Local Search - Population-Based Iterated Local Search}
\subsubsection{Why Population-Based for Dynamic Problems}
-> Local Iterative
-> Provides multiple solutions to a problem
-> Good fit for dynamic -> check which solution is best for changed circumstances
-> Good fit to stop getting stuck in local optima
-> Better than the above
\subsubsection{Implementation in Signal/Collect}
