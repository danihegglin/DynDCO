\chapter{Limitations \& Future Work}
\label{c:limitations}

The main limiting factor in the work was the time to test more algorithms and more problems and more aspects of dynamic constraint optimization problems. \newline
It would be interesting to see how the performance of other problems is.
\newline
 The meeting scheduling problem could also be further explored by increasing the amount of maximum meeting participations of an agent. The amount of participations was limited during the course of this thesis to not further expand the number of possible cases for benchmarking. 
 \newline
 The aspect of changing domains was also not much researched despite being in the framework as a possible test. This was mostly because of the lack of impact respectively damaging impact changed timeslots  had on the scheduling problem. One could further investigate this property of dynamic constraint optimization problems. \cite{Yedidsion} -> have explored this
\newline
The aspect of changing functions
