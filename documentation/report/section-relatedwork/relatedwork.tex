\section{Dynamic Distributed Constraint Optimization}

    - related work
    - formal definition of a constraint optimization problem
    
    - related work: soDistributed Constraint Satisfaction (DisCSP) was formalized (Yokoo et al. 1998). Here,
    - why distributed how
    
    - related work: Petcu, mailler, find more
    - aspects of dynamic environments
    - what can change in a problem
    - benchmarking possibilities

\section{Meeting Scheduling Problem}   
    - related work: find definition again that is citable -> book chapter 12
    - explanation with formal definition
    - example

\section{Algorithm Design Approaches}

    Other Approaches

    - brief related work
    - brief explanation of approaches and why they don't fit: too much information sent, centralized, too complicated, not localized
