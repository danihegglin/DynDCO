\subsection{Resilience to dynamic Environments}
- Mainly to proof flaws of the other approaches when it comes to dynamic
\subsection{Solution Quality}
- Static / Dynamic
- Mainly to proof the ability of new approaches to keep stable and reach certain goals
\subsection{Time to Convergence}

\subsection{Scalability}
-  Number of Messages
- Number of Agents
- Mainly to show that local-iterative scales well because the number of messages is low
\subsection{Hardware Requirements}
- Additional layer of argumentation and analysis
