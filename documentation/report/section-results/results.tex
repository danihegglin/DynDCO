\chapter{Benchmark}
\section{Experiment Design}
The experiments are designed in a two-step procedure accoring to ?

\section{Testing Environment}

\section{Results I: Algorithms Performance Basic}

- Mainly to proof flaws of the other approaches when it comes to dynamic
\subsection{Solution Quality}
- Static / Dynamic
- Mainly to proof the ability of new approaches to keep stable and reach certain goals
\subsection{Time to Convergence}
- Heatmap


\subsection{Scalability}
-  Number of Messages
- Number of Agents
- Number of conflicts
- Mainly to show that local-iterative scales well because the number of messages is low

\section{Results II: Algorithms Performance in Dynamic Environments}

- Rate / Avg. Conflicts - Density
- Stability
- Different Scenarios: Constraints, Variables, Domain

\subsection{Resilience to dynamic Environments}
\subsection{Time to Convergence}
\subsection{Scalability}
