//  ODPOP(X , D, R): each agent xi does:

//1 At completion, xi knows Pi

//Main process
//2 sent goods ← ∅
//3 if xi
//is root then
//ASK/GOOD until valuation sufficiency
//4 else
//5 while !received VALUE message do
//6 Process incoming ASK and GOOD messages
//Process ASK
//7 while !sufficiency conditional on sent goods do
//8 select C
//ask
//i
//among Ci
//9 send ASK message to all C
//ask
//i
//10 wait for GOOD messages
//11 find best good ∈ Sepi s.t. best good /∈ sent goods
//12 add best good to sent goods, and send it to Pi
//Process GOOD(gd, xk)
//13 add gd to goodstore(xk)
//14 check for conditional sufficiency
