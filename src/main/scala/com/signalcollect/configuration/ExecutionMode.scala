 *  	- PureAsynchronousExecutionMode
 *  	- OptimizedAsynchronousExecutionMode

   *  In the synchronous execution mode there are computation steps.

   *  that are above the signal threshold get executed.
   *  During the collect phase the collect function of all vertices that have collect scores
   *  that are above the collect threshold get executed.
   *

   *  Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) paradigm and similar to Google Pregel.
